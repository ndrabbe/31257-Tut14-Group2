# Objectives of the system

- The system will adjust the call flow rate to suitable Relationship Managers (RM) 
- To provide improved call routing and dynamic call flow control for both inbound and outbound calls 
- To improve the call flow rate is to match customers based on RM performance and product knowledge 
- Matching end-customers to well informed RMs with appropriate knowledge about the destination and its traditions 
- Be able to use the customer profiles created from the Profiler Tool ( looks at age, sex, culture, language proficiency, experience and product knowledge) to match users with appropriate RM, to improve sales. 
- The system will adjust the RMs profile according to subsequent performance in selling packages and in serving customers effectively and efficiently. 
- With outbound calls, the system dials numbers automatically according to a customer target list generated by the system 
- The system retrieves customers details from a database. It then displays the details and provides the RM with guidelines and a script to help in providing an improved service 
- The system will create a target list for each RM based on their skills and profile. A target list is a list of tuples in the format <potential customer, product proposed> 
- A skill score is calculated based on the RM’s previous call duration and profile.
- A score from 1-10 based on the likelihood to purchase the product is given to a customer according to some preloaded criteria 
- During busy times, inbound customers can be directed to an Interactive Voice Response (IVP)
- The IVP will prompt users for options, and may even ask for call reasons in a few words and then redirect the call to an Automatic Call Distributor routing the call to the first available appropriate RM.

# Define the problem

- The number and nature of holiday packages offered by travel companies complicate the operation of the system.
- Inconsistent expectations: stakeholders may have different views on the functionality of the software.
- Data security: ensure that privacy standards are followed and that customers' personal information is not disclosed.
- During the software implementation phase, employees may find it difficult to adapt to the new system from the start.
- Stakeholders may have different views on the functionality of the software, which may lead to different expectations.

-------------  
# Stakeholders

- Relationship Managers 
- Customers 
- Developers of the system 
- Tourist attraction providers: They are stakeholders. Travel companies are the medium. So they also get benefit.

-------------
# Assumptions

- We will have to assume what the criteria is for likelihood on a person buying the product. (e.g. purchase history) 
- Is the profiler tool an assumption? 
- Employees answer their questionnaire truthfully
- Company have a high-end computer to ensure the normal operation of the system during peak hours
- The system has a secure firewall to ensure the safety of customer and employee information.
- CMC's skill score scoring standard should also refer to RM mark to purchase desire of customers. For example: if some customers have a short phone call for consultation, but they have a desire to buy.
- The company has sufficient funds and resources to ensure the development of the information system.

# Analysis and design

By reading the text, we can understand the emotions and beliefs of a major travel company. The company hopes to develop an information system to improve the operation of its internal call management center (CMC). The company hopes that the new system will adjust the call flow rate to the appropriate customer relationship manager (RM). In this way, accurate and efficient service can be achieved to match the information between the RM and the customer so that the customer can successfully purchase the travel package. In contrast, the company now does not have this new system so that the information between RM and customers can not be similarly matched, resulting in less sales of travel packages. Customers can not truly understand the true response of the content of the travel package area they want to purchase. RM can not provide timely and true feedback to customers regarding the content of travel packages. It can also be seen from the article that in the traditional system, CMC does not give customers priority call distribution services based on skill scores. On the other hand, the company's old system also did not include directing inbound customers to the interactive voice response unit when it encountered a busy period. This will enable the customer to have a response when making a call and wait, so that the customer will not feeling of being unable to make a call all the time. As a result, customers give up calling the company's sales hotline.

## Define

The main problem is that this large travel company needs to develop an information system to improve the operation of its internal call management center (CMC). The new system will allow end customers to be well matched with well-informed account managers with appropriate knowledge about the destination and its traditions. In addition, RM's personal files and skill matrix are obtained and entered into the system through a 10-minute questionnaire survey by employees. On the other hand, when the system uses outgoing calls to target potential buyers, the system will automatically dial the number based on the customer target list generated by the system. For inbound calls, CMC has its own dedicated automatic branch exchange to route calls. In this regard, the new system will be able to evaluate the customer's skill scores to achieve the highest score will get the inbound call service first. The skill score is calculated based on the call duration and personal data before RM. Finally, the new system will be able to direct inbound customers to interactive voice response units during peak hours.

## Ideation (Draft)
### WE MET . . . 
Ordinary and chaotic call management center    
### WE WERE SURPRISED TO NOTICE . . . 
The call management center can not match RM and customers based on RM's skills and customer profiles.
### WE WONDER IF THIS MEANS . . . 
Due to the implementation of holiday packages, we hope to develop an information system to improve the precise                matching of customers and relationship managers to create high profits.) 
### IT WOULD BE GAME CHANGING TO . . . 
With the successful development of the information system. This will greatly improve the efficiency of the call management center, resulting in a good match between RM and customers. This move can save the company's time costs (call costs) and labor costs (precise matching avoids many RMs in the same and repeating area).

## Not relevant at the moment, just the idea of system operation
1. Outbound call: The customer can place an order through a mobile terminal device such as an iPad or smartphone, and the order is stored in the system database. Then it will be sent to the information system through the central control computer. The information system will retrieve the customer's detailed information from the order information in the database and match it to the appropriate RM, and then transmit it to the CMC. The CMC will direct the automatic call distributor to automatically dial the buyer's phone if the RM phone is idle. If the answer is successful, then transfer to RM. If the answer is unsuccessful, continue to call the next buyer according to the information transmitted by the information system.

2. Inbound calls: CMC has a dedicated automatic branch exchange to route calls. Customers dial the number that arrives at the CMC through their mobile device, and the information system will identify the customer with the highest skill score to receive priority service. CMC directs their calls to RM based on skill level and best match. When the RM's online phone is unavailable, CMC directs inbound customers to the interactive voice response unit, prompts them to choose the travel package they want to consult, or describes the reason for the call, and then feeds back the obtained information to CMC. CMC matches the feedback information with the RM information of the information system, and transmits all the adapted RM phones to the automatic call distributor to adjust the customer's call routing to the first available appropriate RM. When the customer waits for a long time, CMC will prompt and hang up the phone.

3. Information system:

A. Customer skill score is calculated based on the call duration and personal data before RM. According to some pre-loaded criteria, customers are given a score from 1-10 based on the likelihood of buying a product (for example, repeat customers may score higher, customers from a particular postcode may score lower, etc.).

B. Profiler Tool:

• Employee profile: RM configuration file is initialized during recruitment. Employees will initially conduct a 10-minute questionnaire survey to establish personal profiles and skill matrices. The information system will be scored and adjusted based on RM's sales performance and efficient customer service performance.

• Customer profile: The information system will divide the customer ’s postal code and surname into social and cultural segments based on the order and create a customer profile.
