# Define the problem

The main problem is that this large travel company needs to develop an information system to improve the operation of its internal call management center (CMC). The new system will allow end customers to be well matched with well-informed account managers with appropriate knowledge about the destination and its traditions. In addition, RM's personal files and skill matrix are obtained and entered into the system through a 10-minute questionnaire survey by employees. On the other hand, when the system uses outgoing calls to target potential buyers, the system will automatically dial the number based on the customer target list generated by the system. For inbound calls, CMC has its own dedicated automatic branch exchange to route calls. In this regard, the new system will be able to evaluate the customer's skill scores to achieve the highest score will get the inbound call service first. The skill score is calculated based on the call duration and personal data before RM. Finally, the new system will be able to direct inbound customers to interactive voice response units during peak hours.

# Objectives of the system

- The system will adjust the call flow rate to suitable Relationship Managers (RM) 
- To provide improved call routing and dynamic call flow control for both inbound and outbound calls 
- To improve the call flow rate is to match customers based on RM performance and product knowledge 
- Matching end-customers to well informed RMs with appropriate knowledge about the destination and its traditions 
- Be able to use the customer profiles created from the Profiler Tool ( looks at age, sex, culture, language proficiency, experience and product knowledge) to match users with appropriate RM, to improve sales. 
- The system will adjust the RMs profile according to subsequent performance in selling packages and in serving customers effectively and efficiently. 
- With outbound calls, the system dials numbers automatically according to a customer target list generated by the system 
- The system retrieves customers details from a database. It then displays the details and provides the RM with guidelines and a script to help in providing an improved service 
- The system will create a target list for each RM based on their skills and profile. A target list is a list of tuples in the format <potential customer, product proposed> 
- A skill score is calculated based on the RM’s previous call duration and profile.
- A score from 1-10 based on the likelihood to purchase the product is given to a customer according to some preloaded criteria 
- During busy times, inbound customers can be directed to an Interactive Voice Response (IVP)
- The IVP will prompt users for options, and may even ask for call reasons in a few words and then redirect the call to an Automatic Call Distributor routing the call to the first available appropriate RM. 

# Stakeholders

- Relationship Managers 
- Customers 
- Developers of the system 
- Tourist attraction providers
- Travel Company

# Assumptions

- We will have to assume what the criteria is for likelihood on a person buying the product. (e.g. purchase history) 
- The profiler tool can match properly based on age, sex, culture, language proficiency etc. based on the inputs of the customer.
- The system should be able to calculate the employee(RM) score properly based on previous sales.
- The profiler has enough information to successfully match RM and customer.
- Employees answer their questionnaire truthfully
- Company have a high-end servers to ensure the normal operation of the system during peak hours
- The system has a secure firewall to ensure the safety of customer and employee information.
- CMC's skill score scoring standard should also refer to RM mark to purchase desire of customers. For example: if some customers have a short phone call for consultation, but they have a desire to buy.
- The company has sufficient funds and resources to ensure the development of the information system.
- The call centre has RMs from different backgrounds and experiences already to give a variety to the profiler tool to match from.

## Reflection

### Brainstorm #1

By reading the text, we can understand the emotions and beliefs of a major travel company. The company hopes to develop an information system to improve the operation of its internal call management center (CMC). The company hopes that the new system will adjust the call flow rate to the appropriate customer relationship manager (RM). In this way, accurate and efficient service can be achieved to match the information between the RM and the customer so that the customer can successfully purchase the travel package. In contrast, the company now does not have this new system so that the information between RM and customers can not be similarly matched, resulting in less sales of travel packages. Customers can not truly understand the true response of the content of the travel package area they want to purchase. RM can not provide timely and true feedback to customers regarding the content of travel packages. It can also be seen from the article that in the traditional system, CMC does not give customers priority call distribution services based on skill scores. On the other hand, the company's old system also did not include directing inbound customers to the interactive voice response unit when it encountered a busy period. This will enable the customer to have a response when making a call and wait, so that the customer will not feeling of being unable to make a call all the time. As a result, customers give up calling the company's sales hotline.

### Brainstorm #2

Seeing as the aim of the system is to improve the operation of the CMC there will be limited input by users. There will be heavy emphasis on automation, increasing the flow rate of calls to improve the rate of sale.It was brainstormed that a typical workflow would look like the following.

##### For inbound calls:

The customer would call ‘major travel company’, they would be assigned a score between 1-10. The system will look at the caller’s profile and determine which RM is most suitable for the customer and puts them in a waiting queue for this RM. During times of high traffic times, customers will be prompted by an Interactive Voice Response unit which will ask questions to further narrow down which RM they should talk to. They are redirected to the Automatic Call Distributor (ACD) which will then route them to the next relevant RM available. 

##### For Outbound calls:

The system will automatically dial a number to an end-customer based on the RM’s target list. The system will get the details of the end-customer from its database and display it to the RM. Additionally the system will provide a script and guidelines to help the RM provide an enhanced service to the end-customer. 

It is important to note that a target list is created by looking at the end-customer's profile, the system will determine some holiday packages it believes the user will be interested in buying. Following this it searches through all the RMs in the company to determine which one of them is most relevant to sell the proposed product. Finally, the target list is compiled into the format <potential customer, product proposed> and is appointed to the relevant RM. 

##### New assumptions found

Through our brainstorming the following assumptions were found:
- All current Relationship Managers have already completed the questionnaire.  
- Relationship Managers will have access to a computer which is connected to the system as well as the internet.

# Competitive Advantages And Possible Effects If The Project Fails
-------------

## Competitive Advantages

- the new in-house call management centre would boost the chances of travel company recieving more travel packages and put it ahead of competetion.
- the specialized matching technique of the call centre will help the company provide unparallel customer service to their customers and market it as their speciality.
- the customers would prefer the travel company as it will take them lesser time to find a great travel plan/package for themselves, making it their go to travel company.
- The customers will get a personalized experience online without the hassle of visiting the travel agent office.

## Possible Effects from Failure
 
- if the calling system fails, it might cost the travel company a lot as they have invested in the calling centre, employees(RMs), calling software, profiler tool etc.
- the RMs will need to be re trained to handle the new system and there might be a case there the travel company scraps off the whole project leading to job losses.
- Any advertisements or promotions done by the travel company to promote their new calling system might get negative attention and lead to various unhappy customers.
- stakeholder dissatisfaction
- pressure on business executives
- reduced shareholder wealth
- possible closure of business
- market share declined
- inaccurate financial reporting
- non-compliance with key business requirements
- unnecessary exposure to news and system failures on online platforms


## Outline of Scrum Activities Used
-------------

During the duration of this project we have used Scrum as our Agile methodology. Scrum involves constant improvements through changes to the project. This is supported by ‘daily stand-ups' where the team will come together and discuss what they are working on, and if they have any ‘blockers’ and try to figure out a way to solve these ‘blockers’. These stands-ups are enforced by the ‘scum-master’ who is in charge of making sure the scrum methodology is being applied throughout to the project. Similarly there is the used of a product backlog; a backlog which is prioritised in which all user stories are placed. This indicates all of the features that must be achieved before the end of the project. 

In our project we thought daily ‘stands ups’ were not really feasible so instead we opted for weekly ‘stand ups’. Once a week we tried to get into a discord call to discuss about our progress in the project. This was quite useful as we were able to help each other out and we could work on diagrams as a team. We also had a project board which represented our product backlog, we added issues which were assigned to milestones which represented our sprints. We wanted to do 3 sprints however we changed it to 2 sprints as we felt is was more feasible with how busy team members were with other university assignments. We had Nathan appointed as ‘scrum-master', he was in-charge of initiating the calls and making sure the project board was updated.
